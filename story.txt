Yesterday I arrived in the wonderful Berlin Flughafen, ready to start my vacation. 
My suitcase packed with Lederhosen was waiting for me at the baggage claim.
Professor Melhase picked me up in her Porsche.
I turned off the Klimaanlaage and rolled down the windows to feel the wind in my hair.
We stopped at the Biergarten to grab a drink.
