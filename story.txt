A Weesenstein story...

Yesterday I arrived in the wonderful Berlin Flughafen, ready to start my vacation. 
My suitcase packed with Lederhosen was waiting for me at the baggage claim.
Professor Melhase picked me up in her Porsche.
I turned off the Klimaanlaage and rolled down the windows to feel the wind in my hair.
We stopped at the Biergarten to grab a drink.
We were hungry but the only food they had was stale Brot.
We decided instead to look for a restaurant on the Hauptstrasse.
A Hund friendly restaurant with cute clientele caught our eye.
The restaurant was adjacent to a baeckerei that had amazing apfelkuchens.
But rather than an apfelkuchens we decided a dozen doners would do us well.
At the restaurant, we were quickly greeted by a pleasant lady wearing a Dirndl.
